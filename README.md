# DSA Pracs

## Prac 1 - Files and Sorting

 - [x] Bubble Sort 
 - [x] Selection Sort
 - [x] Insertion Sort
 - [x] Exploring Run Times
 - [x] Sorting a File
 
 ### Files
 
 * DSAsorts.py
    - contains classes and methods for bubble, insertion and selection sorts
    - if run as "main" has its own little test
 * bubble_test.py
 * insertion_test.py
 * selection_test.py
    - above three files iteratively perform sorts on lists
    of increasing size and output plot of time complexity growth
 * bsi_test.py
 * names_sorter.py
    - reads 'RandomNames.csv'
    - takes user input to determine which sort to perform
    - performs sort and writes to 'sorted_names.csv'
 * SortsTestHarness.py
    - original test harness
    - Usage: python SortsTestHarness.py n xy [xy ...]

## Prac 2 - Stacks and Queues

 - [x] UML Diagrams
 - [x] Implement Stack and Queue
 - [ ] Equation Solver
 - [x] Tower of Hanoi
 
  ### Files
 
 * DSAPrac2.py
    - deprecated original module containing stack and queue class
 * Equation_solver.py
 * Hanoi.py
    - recursive towers of Hanoi implementation
 * myQueue.py
    - contains queue class and methods
 * myStack.py
    - contains stack class and methods
 * reporting.py
    - little module that outputs runtime information
 * StackQueueTest.py
    - simple test for stack and queue classes
    
## Prac 3 - Linked Lists and Iterators

 - [ ] Linked Lists - Single/Single
 - [ ] Linked Lists - Double/Double 
 - [ ] Iterable Lists
 - [ ] Queue with Linked List
 - [ ] Stack with Linked List
 
  ### Files
 
 * UnitTestLinkedList.py
 * linked.py
 * lltest.py
 
 ## Prac 4 - Trees
 
 - [ ] Creating Treenode
 - [ ] Create Binary Search Tree
 - [ ] Add code to traverse the tree
 - [ ] Implement Additional Operations
 - [ ] Add File I/O to Overall Program
